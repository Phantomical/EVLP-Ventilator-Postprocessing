Help for preprocess.py 
Usage:
    preprocess.py <input-file> <output-file> [options]

Options:
    --help
        Prints out this help page and exits.
    --standard-preprocess
        Runs all the preprocessing steps. If you are
        unsure as to which flags to specify, this is 
        the one you most likely want. Equivalent to
        specifying --convert-to-csv, --strip-headers,
        --remove-empty-datapoints, --reformat-hours,
        and --calc-plateau-pressure.
    --convert-to-csv
        Indicates that the input file should be converted
        from the .si format into a .csv format. This step
        must be done before all other steps can be carried
        out.
    --strip-headers
        Causes the script to remove all lines that give 
        information on the machine doing the ventilation
        or information on pre-use tests.
    --remove-empty-datapoints
        Causes the script to remove all time points which
        do not have any associated data values.
    --reformat-hours
        Causes the script to reformat the time values from
        time of day to time since start of ventilation.
    --calc-plateau-pressure
        Adds an extra column to the output that calculates
        the plateau pressure from the tidal volume, static
        compliance and PEEP. The calculated results are 
        generally more accurate than the plateau pressure
        values that are recorded by the machine.

Help for sample.py 
Usage:
    sample.py <input-file> <output-file> [options]

Options:
    --help
        Prints this help page.
    --filter-irrelevant
        Filters out all columns from the output except
        for time, dynamic compliance, mean airway pressure,
        static compliance, and calculated plateau pressure
    --sample-period=[pre|post|during]
        Indicates whether to sample before the recruitment/
        assessment, during it, or after it.
    --sample-param=[recruitment|assessment]
        Indicates whether to sample around recruitments or
        assessments.
    --sample-offset=<time>
        Indicates how long before or after recruitment/assessment
        to sample. <time> is in minutes.
